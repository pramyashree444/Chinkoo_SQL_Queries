# Chinkoo_SQL_Queries
SQL_Qeries_Internship
This project uses the Chinook database to practice SQL basics.
I explored tables using SELECT and COUNT queries.
I performed filtering using WHERE, sorting using ORDER BY,
aggregation using SUM and GROUP BY, and filtering grouped results using HAVING.
I also used BETWEEN for date filtering and LIKE for pattern matching.
Query 1: Total sales by Billing Country
Query 2: Total amount spent by each customer
Query 3: Top 10 invoices by total
Query 4: Invoices in 2013
Query 5: Customers whose first name starts with A
